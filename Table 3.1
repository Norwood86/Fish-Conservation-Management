# The first step to completing box 3.1 is importing the data into R.
# I have downloaded the zip file from the crcpress.com and taken the eggs and fish 
# columns and saved them seperately as a CSV in order to ease the transport.

getwd()

# I will make the csv available for the x axis (crab body weight (g)) and the y axis
# (number of eggs in ('000s)). The location of that file on your computer (right-click
# --> properties --> under general tab --> copy and paste the location between quotation
# marks in setwd() command.

setwd("C:\\\\Users\\pault\\Desktop\\UMass\\Spring_2019\\Fisheries")
list.files()
fish <- read.csv("Box3.1.csv", check.names = FALSE)
fish
class(fish)

# The calculations for the subsequent rows of data are easy enough to conduct using 
# R. But first I need to set the variables for the Gradient (slope) and the intercept.
# I will store them as m and b, respectively.

m1 <- 2.59998891
b1 <- 21.50984071

m2 <- 2.370186364
b2 <- 17.080

# The predSSQ and predSAR rows will be calculated as follows. I did the calculation
# in the first line and then "printed" the results with the second line in order to 
# verify their accuracy:

predSSQ <- (fish$Size * m1) + b1 
predSSQ

predSAR <- (fish$Size * m2) + b2
predSAR

# I did the same for the sum of squares column and sum of absolute values column:

SSQ <- (fish$Eggs - predSSQ)^2
SSQ


SAR <- abs(fish$Eggs - predSAR)
SAR

# Now that all the data has been populated, it's time to plot the data and look to
# see which method appears to give the best fit by eye in accordance with the 
# directions found on page 65.

# I had some difficulty in plotting the lines, so I will use the following command
# to add the columns to the original table. With all of the data in the same data.frame
# it should be easier to work with.

fish <- cbind(fish, predSSQ, predSAR, SSQ, SAR)
fish

# First the data:

plot(Eggs~Size, data = fish, xlim = c(0,250), ylim = c(0,800), pch = 19, 
     ylab = "Number of Eggs ('000)", xlab = "Crab Body Weight (g)",
     main = "Reproduction of Figure 3.3")

# And now I will begin fitting lines to it.

lines(predSSQ~Size, data = fish, lty = 1)
lines(predSAR~Size, data = fish, lty = 2)

legend("topleft", bty = "n", legend = c("predSSQ", "predSAR"), lty = 1:2)

# Now I may conduct the analysis as suggested in box 3.1. This comparison will be
# written out in an attached document to be submitted.
